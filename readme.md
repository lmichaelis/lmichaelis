# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I'm Luis,a self-taught full-stack software developer from Germany. I currently work at a large research institute writing software for research into renewable energy and analysis of existing systems. There, I mostly work with _Python_ and _TypeScript_ developing internal web applications.

Apart from those programming languages I'm also well-versed in _Java_ and _C++_. In fact, I am currently working on a C++ library called [phoenix](https://github.com/lmichaelis/phoenix) which implements file formats used by an early 2000's game-engine called _ZenGin_.

## ðŸ’¾ My Projects
