# üìç About Me

Hi, I'm Luis! I'm a self-taught full-stack software developer from Germany. After dropping out of University, I'm now working at a research institute writing code for ongoing research projects. I'm most familiar writing Python and C++ code, though most of my work is done using Python and TypeScript. I am, however, also familiar with Java and Rust though I haven't worked with many frameworks in these languages.

I also use Linux on my personal computers and I'm well-versed in Linux server administration and setup.
